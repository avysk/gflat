# GFlat

## What is it

GFlat is a very easy to use scaffolding solution for simple F# projects. It uses
[Paket](https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket),
[FAKE](https://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/) and
[Forge](https://github.com/fsharp-editing/Forge). These tools, while powerful,
may be not straightforward to use; GFlat is not powerful but allows you to start
with F# project in a very straightforward manner.

## Assumptions

You are using `mono`, have working `make` and ready to download half of the
Internet.

## How to use

Grab the release; unarchive it. GFlat will create the project consisting of the
following parts: library, main application and tests for the library. You may
want to edit `Makefile` and specify the name for the main application (`APP`, by
default it is `Program`) and for the library (`LIB`, by default it is `Lib`).
The test project will be named automatically, by appending `.Test` to the
library name.

After you have specified desired names, run `make populate` and let it run till
the end. That's it.

## What will I get?

Three projects:
* the library is `src/lib`
* the main application in `src/app`
* the test project in `src/test`, set up for usage of `FsUnit`.

Both the main application and the test project have the library set as a
reference, so you can start using it right away.

Four targets for `make`:
* `make build` compiles the library and main application; you'll find the
  resulting `.exe` file in `build/` directory.
* `make run` does the same as above plus the compiled application will be run
  when it is ready.
* `make test` compiles the library, the tests, and runs the tests with
  [NUnit3](http://nunit.org/) console runner.
* `make release` builds the release (i.e. non-debug) version of the application. 

## Example of usage

1. `make populate` (...runs for ages, downloads half of the internet; in the process you 
will see some ignored errors from Forge...)
        
        Done.
        Ignored errors are safe to ignore.

        Application source code is in src/app/Program/Program.fs
        Library source code is in src/lib/Lib/Lib.fs
        Tests source code is in src/test/Lib.Test/Lib.Test.fs
        Try 'make test' now.
        Happy hacking!

2. `tree src`

        src
        ├── app
        │   └── Program
        │       ├── App.config
        │       ├── Program.fs
        │       ├── Program.fsproj
        │       └── paket.references
        ├── lib
        │   └── Lib
        │       ├── Lib.fs
        │       ├── Lib.fsproj
        │       └── paket.references
        └── test
            └── Lib.Test
                ├── Lib.Test.fs
                ├── Lib.Test.fsproj
                └── paket.references

        6 directories, 10 files

3. `make build && ls build/` (...some noise...)

        FSharp.Core.dll    Lib.dll.mdb        Program.exe.config
        Lib.dll            Program.exe        Program.exe.mdb

4. `make run` (should calculate 3 squared) (...some noise...)

        9

5. `make test` (...some noise...)

        1) Failed : Lib.Test.Example Test
          Expected: 3
          But was:  4

...more noise...
 
## Disclaimer
 
I did this only to simplify the things for myself when playing with F#. Tested
only on Mac. If it works for you and you find it useful -- great! If not,
report the problem and I may have a look. Or send a patch.
